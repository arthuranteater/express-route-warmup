# Building a server

## Instructions
- I've given you a blank app.js, a package.json, and a data.js file
- You will need to install your dependancies, then write your server code in the app.js
- You will write two different routes, one to get all of the data, and one to get ONE piece of data by the id
- For the base get route, ('/'), you will to return all the data in data.js
- For the get by id route, ('/:id'), you will to return the piece of data that matches the id passed in the url
- Google will be your friend
- After we get this up and running, we'll deploy to heroku together.
